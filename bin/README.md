### Main routines

This folder contains the scripts used to generate and process the data used by our team after pre-processing all sequencing files. This pre-processing can be done following the instructions found in [Time-resolved metagenomic sequencing of Lenski's long-term evolution experiment with Escherichia coli ](https://github.com/benjaminhgood/LTEE-metagenomic), and place files in *data_files/preProcess* folder

To run our pipeline using pre-processed sequencing files provided [here](https://github.com/LabBiosystemUFRN/Ecoli60/tree/master/data_files/preProcess/), simply execute
> 00pipeline.sh
